PyLife is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Features
Interactive Simulation: PyLife provides an interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life, allowing users to observe the evolution of cell patterns over time.
Graphical Interface: The simulator features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Pygame and Tkinter, making it easy to customize simulation parameters and visualize the game.
Optimized Algorithms: PyLife uses optimized algorithms to efficiently calculate the next generation of cells, ensuring smooth and fast simulation even for large grid sizes.
